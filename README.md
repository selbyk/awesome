awesome
=======

My awesome config.  I'm not a minimalist, I just think tiling window mangers narrow my focus and make me more productive.  I always install awesome on top of a full install of KDE.

Getting up on *buntu:

1. `sudo apt-get install awesome-desktop`
2. `git clone git@github.com:selbyk/awesome.git`
3. `cp -r ./awesome/awesome ~/.config`
4. `sudo reboot`


[rc.lua](https://github.com/selbyk/awesome/blob/master/awesome/rc.lua) is the brains of awesome, and [here](http://tylerneylon.com/a/learn-lua/) is a good tutorial on the basics you need to get started with Lua.

A lot of the fancier features require further install, like compton & xredshift but Ubuntu has all of them in their repositories.  If you like my terminal colors, you might want to check out my [dotfiles](https://github.com/selbyk/dotfiles).
